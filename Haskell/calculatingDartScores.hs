-- dartCalculator score
-- This is a function that takes an Int as input, in the form of a score. For the assignment we need to
-- output a result in the form of a combination of a*x, b*y, c*z, where a, b and c can range from [1, 3] and x, y, z can range from [1, 20].
-- We can see a, b and c as weights for each x, y, z.
-- We recognize that there is a rather limited set amount of cases as to how we can set up the weights, so the solution here is to set up lists using list
-- comprehension, one for each combination of weighs. Since the order does not matter, that is the problem
-- only wants us to present one solution if there is one, we have only 9 lists to take into account. We step into each list and try to match it with the given
-- score.
-- If there is a match we output the x, y, z in a list and concat it with a list with a, b, c. That is to be certain for our next problem which one is a single
-- which one is a double and which one is a tripple.
-- If there is no match, the function will instead just return a list with a single list element that holds the value of 181, which denotes impossibility.
-- Futhermore the next function will know if just a single element is in the list (That is a, b, c are discarded) that we found no solution. It should then
-- just print out "impossible"
