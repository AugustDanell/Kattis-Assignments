-- factorial
-- Simple factorial function that returns n factorial n-1, that is n times the next factorial
-- or 1 if the factorial of 0 i reached.

factorial :: Integer -> Integer
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial n-1

-- factorialCalls
-- The idea is to make it so the function takes an integer N that determines exactly how
-- many times the faculty of a certain integer should be calculated. This is then to be inserted
-- into a tail-recursive list. Lastly the idea is to have this list brought back to a function that
-- should take the list and just print every entry.
