## Kattis
In regards to my daily life I often also solve problems at Kattis. Kattis is a site where one can solve programming problems and as of right now I have solved some hundred programming problems there. Within this directory I plan to upload my solutions to the problems that I have solved, for anyone to see. For many of these problems the documentation will be all but nought and I suspect that the overall writing is of much poorer nature than that of my other projects. I mostly care only for the solving of problems under a reasonable time complexity and as such the code in this directory is not very well written.

Overall I think Kattis is an excellent resource for learning and maintaining skills in a programming language. The problems are of a very varying degree and so in order to accumulate points after a while, when all the easy problems have been exhausted, one is forced to tackle harder problems. For an employer Kattis is also good in that the employer can use Kattis for their own coding interviews or they can simply look at a user's score. This removes ambiguity, for instance, if a user has multiple thousands as their score the employer can discern that this is someone that has solved A LOT of coding problems, and I think it is as such a better system then looking at for instance the amounts of commits a user has (because a commit is ambigous in terms of work, a commit can be 5 minutes of lazy coding or 2 hours of well documented work). 

I think also that Kattis is a very good tool for a programmer trying to learn a language. As I am writng this explanation of what Kattis is I am currently solving many easier problems in C# specifically. These are problems I have already solved in languages like Python and Java but using a new language to solve such problems is a very good way of learning the syntax of that language, I have found. Right now I am wanting to learn Unity and the underlaying language which is C# and so I am doing many Kattis assignments in C# specifically. I then push them here and in case I forget something in the future the plan is that I can easily just look at the C# directory specifically. 

### Languages
The majority of assignments in this repository have been solved in Java or in Python, but for the fun of it I have been using other languages as well, especially some interesting declarative languages such as Prolog that is used in logic programming and Haskell that is used in functional programming. Certain problems, like the kattis problem called 'busnumbers' was much easier to solve using a language like Haskell that is of a different paradigm of thinking as compared to Java, and the time it took to find the correct solution was also less in my Haskell solution, I found. Those languages are as such naturally ordered in respective directories:

- C#
- C++
- C
- COBOL
- Haskell
- Java
- Javascript (NODE JS)
- Prolog
- Python
