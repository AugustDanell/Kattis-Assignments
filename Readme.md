## Kattis
In regards to my daily life I often also solve problems at Kattis. Kattis is a site where one can solve programming problems and as of right now I have solved some hundred programming problems there. Within this directory I plan to upload my solutions to the problems that I have solved, for anyone to see. For many of these problems the documentation will be all but nought and I suspect that the overall writing is of much poorer nature than that of my other projects. I mostly care only for the solving of problems under a reasonable time complexity and as such the code in this directory is not very well written.

The majority of assignments in this repository have been solved in Java or in Python, but for the fun of it I have been using other languages as well, especially some interesting declarative languages such as Prolog that is used in logic programming and Haskell that is used in functional programming. Certain problems, like the kattis problem called 'busnumbers' was much easier to solve using a language like Haskell that is of a different paradigm of thinking as compared to Java, and the time it took to find the correct solution was also less in my Haskell solution, I found. Those languages are as such naturally ordered in respective directories:

### Languages
- C++
- C
- Haskell
- Java
- Prolog
- Python
