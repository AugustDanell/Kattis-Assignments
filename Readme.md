## Kattis
Kattis is a Swedish equivalence of Leetcode, where on accumulates points through solving problems of varying difficulty. I love to pump in any spare time I have into the project that is to climb the ranklists of Kattis. My language of choice is Python but I do program in a myriad of different languages. Most recently I have been focusing a bit on Javascript Node JS (Although the Kattis Input is poor for node JS) due to working in React and Angular. 

### Languages
The majority of assignments in this repository have been solved in Java or in Python, but for the fun of it I have been using other languages as well, especially some interesting declarative languages such as Prolog that is used in logic programming and Haskell that is used in functional programming. Here are some languages that I have been using:

- C#
- C++
- C
- Haskell
- Java
- Javascript (NODE JS)
- Prolog
- Python
